Physics_Formula_Class

I decided to make a c++ class called Physics and implement each physics example from my tesx book.
At the bottom of the driver.cpp file in the commented out zone, is where each method example is from the book and how it was
solved using this Physics Class. I statred the first couple chapters out keeping accurate track but as more and more methods were
added I decided it was best to start building new classes for the new concepts that are used. Only the first 3 chapters are tracked in
this manner. I tried to build each method using accurate names and i included method header documentation as well to help with what each 
method does and how it is used.
